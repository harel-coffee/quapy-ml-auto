Things to test:
- MultiChain for classification, MultiChain for regression?

- Independent classifiers + independent quantifiers
- Stacking + independent quantifiers
- ClassifierChain + independent quantifiers
- Independent quantifiers + cross-class regression (independent?)
- Stacking + cross-class regression
- ClassifierChain + cross-class regression
- Covariates (Means, CovMatrix from samples) + multioutput regression?
- Covariates concatented with quantifiers predictions + cross-class regression?

- Model Selection for specific protocols?
